They also serve as a vital carbon sink, helping mitigate the effects of climate change. Furthermore, the forest sustains the livelihoods of local communities through fishing, honey collection, and tourism. Efforts to preserve and conserve this unique ecosystem are ongoing, including initiatives to raise awareness, promote sustainable practices, and safeguard the delicate balance between human activities and nature.
